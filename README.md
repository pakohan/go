## restgen

Generate a REST API with CRUD routes (list, get, insert, update, delete) from a Postgres schema. Run the tool without any arguments to start a wizard that will create a folder with a ready-to-run API. If you already have a directory with a restgen.json config file, pass the path to that directory as its first argument.
